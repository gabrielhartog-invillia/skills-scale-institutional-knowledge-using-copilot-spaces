# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

This repository centralizes project management processes, templates, and best practices for OctoAcme teams. The goal is to accelerate onboarding, support repeatable execution, and keep institutional knowledge accessible to all team members, new joiners, and stakeholders.

## Overview of OctoAcme Project Management Processes

OctoAcme's project management approach follows a structured lifecycle that includes Initiation, Planning, Execution & Tracking, Release & Deployment, and Retrospective & Continuous Improvement. This framework ensures that every project moves through clearly defined phases with appropriate checkpoints and deliverables. The process is designed to be flexible enough to accommodate different project types. At the same time, it maintains consistency in how teams collaborate and deliver value.

At the core of our approach are five key principles: customer-first prioritization, iterative delivery of testable increments, clear ownership with named Project Managers and Product Leads, data-informed decision making, and psychological safety that encourages feedback and learning. These principles guide how we work together, make decisions, and continuously improve our processes. Teams are empowered to adapt the framework to their specific needs while maintaining alignment with these foundational values.

Our project teams consist of well-defined roles including Project Managers who coordinate delivery and manage risks, Product Managers who define outcomes and prioritize work, Developers who implement features and collaborate on design, QA/Testing professionals who validate quality, and Stakeholders who provide inputs and approvals.

Communication is structured with regular weekly syncs between PM and Product teams, twice-weekly standups for delivery teams, and monthly stakeholder updates. Risk management and escalation paths are clearly defined to ensure transparency and proactive problem-solving across all projects.

Quality assurance is integrated throughout the project lifecycle, from acceptance criteria definition during planning through automated testing during execution and validation before release. Teams maintain key artifacts including Project Charters, Roadmaps, Sprint Backlogs, Risk Registers, and Retrospective notes to ensure continuity and knowledge sharing. This comprehensive approach helps OctoAcme deliver high-quality products efficiently while building institutional knowledge that benefits the entire organization.
